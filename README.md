# databricks_sql_practice
Notebooks built on Databricks using SQL and PySpark for learning purposes

Data extracted from CSV files and transformed into analyses applicable to real-world data analysis

For the next steps, I plan to implement the SQL queries using PySpark as well, and to create a notebook pipeline to execute all the notebooks in order
