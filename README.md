# databricks_sql_practice
Notebooks built on Databricks using SQL and PySpark for learning purposes

Data extracted from CSV files and transformed into analyses applicable to real-world data analysis

For the next steps, I plan to implement the SQL queries using PySpark as well, and to create a notebook pipeline to execute all the notebooks in order

Skills practiced in this project:

-Databricks.
-Spark - Creating DataFrames, Temp Views and transforming data with Spark and SQL. 
-SQL - Select, Joins, CTEs, Window Functions.
